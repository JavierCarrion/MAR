Implement in Java or C++ an algorithm, which, given a directed graph, 
detects whether it has cycles or not. If it is acyclical, it must list 
its vertices in Topological order. If there is more than one possible, 
it can be listed in any of them. If it is cyclical, it must list its 
Strongly-Connected Components (each one is a set of vertices). 
The algorithm for this second part can be seen in Chapter 22 of the Cormen (2001, second edition).
